# TicTacToe Infinite

Java game made with Processing 4.<br>
This is not just TicTacToe, you can play on a 3x3, 9x9 or any power of 3 grid.<br>
Change the `private static final int DEPTH = X;` in the TicTacToeInfinite.java file to change the depth. (Default is 2)

#### Note

This is not a finished game, I'm planning to convert it to JS and run it on my website.
